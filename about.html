			<h3>Our Founder</h3>

			<h4>Hank Fredlington</h4>

			<p>Hank always loved baking, but he didn’t know the best tools or techniques, so he created his own recipe: A cup of creativity, a dash of community spirit, and a liberal glaze of can-do attitude, and Confectionarium was born.</p>

			<p class="tertiary-copy"><i>“It’s all about the open and sharing spirit that is so essential to the baking community.”</i></p>
